# kcater70
My repo for all my work from my Introduction to Computer Science (Fall 2024 - Spring 2025) class in high school.

Feel free to email or DM me with questions and comments, my socials are on my [profile](https://github.com/kccaterworld)

You can also drop questions/comments in the discussions tab.

In this class, we covered, in order, DrRacket, NetLogo, HTML and CSS, and Python.
Some of my HTML code contains JavaScript but those were my own personal additions, based on prior knowledge.
